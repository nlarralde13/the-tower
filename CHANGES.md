# Change Log ‚Äî Procedural Tower Generation (Dev tools + Engine)

Date: 2025-10-31

## Overview

This log records the set of changes made to implement the distance-band corridor algorithm, add seed export/import for floors, introduce a boss density weight, and improve the Dev page tooling.

## Engine

- Distance-band corridor generation with seeded reproducibility.
  - Carves a guaranteed Entry ‚Üí Exit path, then opens tiles outward in BFS distance bands until reaching the target `openFraction`.
  - Corridor width is controlled by `riverWidth + bandPadding` (clamped ‚â• 0).
  - Blocks are the complement of opened tiles; symmetric ‚Äúriver‚Äù pattern around the path.
  - File: `src/engine/generateFloor.ts`.

- New options (backwards compatible):
  - `bandPadding?: number` ‚Äî widens/tightens corridor beyond `riverWidth`.
  - `blockedFraction?: number` ‚Äî alternative to `openFraction` (interpreted as `1 - blockedFraction`).
  - `mazeMode?: string | boolean` ‚Äî accepted for compatibility; currently unused.

- Floor 1 entry/exit rule:
  - Entry at (3,7) or (4,7); Exit constrained to top two rows.

- New helper to generate from a serialized seed:
  - `export function generateFloorFromSeed(seed: FloorSeed, baseConfig: FloorConfig): FloorGrid`.
  - File: `src/engine/generateFloor.ts`.

## Types

- `RoomRatios` now supports optional `boss?: number` density weight.
  - File: `src/types/tower.ts`.

- New `FloorSeed` type that serializes a reproducible generation request:
  - Fields: `floor`, `seed`, optional `isFinalBossFloor`, `options` (minEmptyFraction, pathEmptyBias, open/blockedFraction, wiggle, riverWidth, optional bandPadding), and `roomRatios` (combat, trap, loot, out, special, optional boss/empty).
  - File: `src/types/tower.ts`.

## Validator

- Recognizes optional `boss` ratio key within `room_ratios`.
  - File: `src/utils/validateRuleset.ts`.

## Ruleset Template

- Adds `boss: 0.00` to each floor‚Äôs `room_ratios` as a documented example.
  - File: `public/data/rulesetTemplate.json`.

## Dev Tools UI (`/dev` page)

- Adds boss to ‚ÄúRoom Density Weights‚Äù controls.
- Randomize controls:
  - ‚ÄúRandom Seed‚Äù button ‚Äî sets a new 32-bit seed.
  - ‚ÄúRandom Weights‚Äù button ‚Äî samples a Dirichlet-like distribution over all ratio keys.
- Seed export/import:
  - ‚ÄúExport Seed JSON‚Äù ‚Äî downloads a `FloorSeed` JSON capturing current knobs for the selected floor.
  - ‚ÄúImport Seed JSON‚Äù ‚Äî loads a seed file, reflects settings into the UI, and immediately generates the floor using `generateFloorFromSeed`.
  - File: `src/app/dev/page.tsx`.

## Notes on Boss Density

- On final floors that require boss-clear, the generator still places one guaranteed boss tile along the path. If `boss` density is also set, additional boss tiles may be assigned by weighted distribution; the generator subtracts one boss from the apportionment when the guaranteed boss exists.

## Compatibility

- Existing rulesets without `boss` remain valid. The validator now accepts `boss` when present.
- The dev page defaults `boss` to 0 if omitted in the ruleset.
- All changes preserve seeded RNG behavior and are additive.

## Session Summary (UI polish, flavor system, map)

### Climb Page
- Restyled to use panel layout for consistency with other pages (.tower-shell + .menu-panel).
- Added randomized Monty Pythonñstyle flavor blurb (5 options) selected on page load.
- Applied a dark overlay to the background to reduce visual noise.

### Per-Room Flavor Text
- Introduced dedicated per-type content files under src/game/flavor/:
  - entry.ts, exit.ts, empty.ts, combat.ts, 	rap.ts, loot.ts, out.ts, special.ts, oss.ts (5 lines each).
- src/game/flavor.ts now imports these files and exposes chooseFlavor() / exitsFlavor().
- src/game/content/flavor.ts updated to wrap chooseFlavor() and return a friendly quip for invalid moves.

### Movement Feedback (no exit)
- When attempting to move into walls/void, the UI/engine now respond with:
  - ìWhy are you running face first into that wall?î
  - Applied in src/app/play/page.tsx D-pad handler and src/game/engine.ts command engine.

### Map Panel (replaces Journal)
- Added a Map panel to /play:
  - 8◊8 grid with 32px tiles.
  - Dark gray = unknown; white = visited; current room shows a circular marker and gold border.
  - Resets on floor ascension by filtering journal entries for the current floor.
  - Mobile: opens below the viewer; Desktop: renders in the right column.

### Misc
- Updated /climb button styles to shared .btn variants.
- General copy edits and small UX consistency tweaks.
